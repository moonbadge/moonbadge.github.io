   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.




Getting Started
==================

Your badge is based on an ESP32-wroom-32 module and a GDEH0213B1 e-paper display. It also contains a KX122-1037 Accelerometer and a footprint for a microsd card that can be soldered on as a soldering exercise.

If your badge has your name on it it's been pre-configured already. If no name has been set the badge will display the OHS logo.

cool!
